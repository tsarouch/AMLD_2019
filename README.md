# AMLD_2019
Repo for content of the AMLD 2019 conference
</br>

The workshop will demonstrate the basic principles of Remote Sensing and how it can be used in real life applications. It is split in two streams:
</br>

**Main stream**</br>
We  share basic concepts and typical Remote Sensing hands-on (Jupyter Notebook) examples.
- Intro in remote sensing & applications in insurance
- Hands on basic concepts and data types
- Classify Land Use teaser example 
- Experimentation with Google Earth Engine
- Dive deeper in Remote Sensing with snow-cloud discrimination example
 </br>

**Hack Stream**</br>
We would not like to keep experts in the room bored. 
Let's hack together solutions on object detections and farm boundaries.
Teams with best solutions might be considered for further collaboration.

**Prerequisites**
- Own laptop + basic programming skills
- Register yourself at  https://earthengine.google.com/ (google earth engine) before coming to the workshop
</br>

**Outcome**
We aim by the end of the workshop, the participants have 
- exposed to the basic concepts of image processing in the context of remote sensing
- informed about the technological challenges and relevant best practices
- pointed to the potential of Remote Sensing in real life applications, like in the insurance world
